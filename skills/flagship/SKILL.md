# Cloudflare Flagship

Use Flagship for runtime feature flags, targeting, and gradual rollouts. Prefer Wrangler `vars` for static deploy-time configuration and KV/D1/Durable Objects for application data.

## Retrieval Sources

Your Flagship knowledge may be outdated. Retrieve current docs before exact API fields, limits, beta status, SDK names, or token scopes.

## Workflow

1. Classify the work: evaluate flags, create/update flags, design rollout rules, migrate from another flag system, or audit existing flags.
2. Inspect `wrangler.*`, generated types, package versions, and existing Flagship app/flag keys before coding.
3. For Workers, prefer the Flagship binding over outbound HTTP calls to Cloudflare APIs.
4. Model flag values deliberately: boolean for gates, string/number/object for variants, and typed defaults for every evaluation.
5. Design targeting and rollout rules with a rollback path. Keep high-risk launches disabled or narrowly targeted until validated.
6. After binding/config changes, run `npx wrangler types` and the project typecheck/tests.

## Workers Binding Pattern

Retrieve current config docs before editing `wrangler.jsonc`; binding shape may change while the product is in beta.

```typescript
const enabled = await env.FLAGS.getBooleanValue("new-checkout", false);
```

Evaluation should happen close to the decision point. Pass user, account, tenant, or request context according to current docs when targeting rules depend on attributes.

## Management API

- Use the API for account-level automation: apps, flags, changelog entries, and flag evaluation.
- Create a scoped API token with Flagship permissions; do not reuse broad account tokens in app code.
- Treat flag keys as stable contracts. Renaming a flag is a migration, not a cosmetic edit.
- Prefer disabled-by-default or conservative default variations when creating flags for production.

## Gotchas

- Always provide a default value in evaluation code so unavailable flag config fails predictably.
- Do not put secrets or sensitive per-user data in flag values, rules, metadata, logs, or audit descriptions.
- Avoid stale flag debt: add an owner, cleanup condition, and expected removal date for temporary rollout flags.
- Do not use Flagship as a general key-value store. If the value is not a feature decision, choose another product.
